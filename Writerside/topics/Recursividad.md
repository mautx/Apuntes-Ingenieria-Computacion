t must be possible to decompose the original problem into simpler
instances of the same problem.
2. Once each of these simpler subproblems has been solved, it must be
   possible to combine these solutions to produce a solution to the original
   problem.
3. As the large problem is broken down into successively less complex
   ones, those subproblems must eventually become so simple that they
   can be solved without further subdivision.
